**** NOTES FOR Alembic Migration AND BACKING UP POSTGRESQL DATABASE***
3. Backup Data
Objective: Ensure you have a copy of your data that can be restored in case something goes wrong during migration.
How To Do It:

Create Backup: Use database tools or commands to create a backup of your database. This can be a SQL dump file or a full database backup.
Restore If Needed: If the migration fails or causes data loss, you can restore the database from the backup.
Example Command for PostgreSQL:

bash
Copy code
-----     pg_dump your_database_name > backup.sql
To restore:

bash
Copy code
-----   psql your_database_name < backup.sql
